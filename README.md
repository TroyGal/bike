# Bike riders Usage Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project focuses on analysing a year’s worth of bike share usage data to uncover trends in rider behaviour, environmental impact, and hourly demand patterns. Using Power BI, I transformed the raw dataset into an interactive dashboard designed to explore how different factors influence bike rental volumes.

## Project Overview

The dataset contains daily records of bike rentals, environmental data, and time-based variables. Key fields include:

- **Date**  
- **Season** (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)  
- **Working Day / Holiday Indicator**  
- **Casual vs Registered Riders**  
- **Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed**  
- **Total Bike Rentals**

---

## Project Goals

- Analyse seasonal trends in bike usage  
- Compare rental patterns between casual and registered users  
- Understand how weather conditions affect daily rentals  
- Identify high and low demand periods across time and day  
- Create a visual, interactive summary for stakeholders

## Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** – Data modelling, DAX, dashboard creation  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and preparation  
- **CSV File** – Raw data from `bike_share_yr_0.csv`

## Dashboard Features

- Filters for season, rider type, and working vs non-working days  
- Line and bar charts showing ride volumes across time  
- Environmental impact visualisation (temperature vs rental correlation)  
- Breakdown of casual vs registered riders  
- Hourly trends by weekday

## Key Insights

Across the week, hourly ride patterns reveal distinct peaks during midday and early evening hours. As lunchtime approaches, a surge in bike usage reflects increased mobility, likely tied to shor

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open the `BikeShareDashboard.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop  
3. Place the CSV file in the `RawData/` folder  
4. Refresh data inside Power BI to update visuals

## Possible Improvements

- Add month-level analysis or time-of-day slicers  
- Compare multiple years (if additional data available)  
- Add external datasets like public transport integration or event data  
- Enable predictive modelling for future demand estimation
